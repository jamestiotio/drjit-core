All backends can be enabled/disabled using CMake flags. When disabled, no
related code is compiled.

Convert ThreadState into a class with abstract virtual functions and subclasses
(CUDAThreadState, etc.) that implement them.

Separate all backend code from the rest of Dr.Jit

Changed the memory allocation interface so that allocations are parameterized
by a JitBackend. The AllocType enumeratoin is gone.

Added very basic Metal backend. Currently, it can only do memory allocation.
